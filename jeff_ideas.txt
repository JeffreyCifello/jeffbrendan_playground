Video game that's stardew-valley like, but modern city setting. 
	-> tasks include problem resolution, small scale city issues (litter, potholes...). Progression could be securing grant money. Specifically game is trying to make boring stuff more interesting/make people want to get more involved in local politics. Could start as text based and once structure is figured out deal with art etc.. 

Video game that combines city simulator with complex policy functions. Could get very deep and complicated.
	This, but focused on telling player to write speeches/policies. Unique thing about game is complex text analysis. Would likely need to leverage 3rd party AI or LLMs.

Economy simulator just for fun. Could turn into game. Focus on housing. Look at available socio-economic data and attempt to simulate/replicate. 
	-> this is a bit of fool's errand/classic case of programmer thinking he can simulate something incredibly complex. Could be fun but hubristic.

Novel AI/representation project. There's a paper out there about IITs and using networks for simulated agents to solve problems/follow a path. Symbolic AI stuff.

Good old fashioned text-adventure game. Maybe something in solar punk genre or wholesome. Mostly to practice writing and world building.

Any web app at all. I don't know web development and it seems fun.

Baseball game prediction model.
	-> I've looked into this a bit. Wrangling previous years data is non-trivial and the way it was saved was surprising. Stats are summarized by specified time windows. I'm not sure what existing models look like despite looking into it a tiny bit. People seem to charge for data that's easier to pull and analyze. Data prep step itself is a pain, before any analysis can happen.
